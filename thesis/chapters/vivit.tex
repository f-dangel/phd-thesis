\subsubsection{Abstract}

Curvature in form of the Hessian or its generalized Gauss-Newton (\ggn)
approximation is valuable for algorithms that rely on a local model for the loss
to train, compress, or explain deep networks.
% What has been done
Existing methods based on implicit multiplication via automatic differentiation
or Kronecker-factored block diagonal approximations do not consider noise in the
mini-batch.
% What we do
We present \vivit, a curvature model that leverages the \ggn's low-rank
structure without further approximations. It allows for efficient computation of
eigenvalues, eigenvectors, as well as per-sample first- and second-order
directional derivatives.
% Computation
The representation is computed in parallel with gradients in one backward pass
and offers a fine-grained cost-accuracy trade-off, which allows it to scale.
% Experiments
We demonstrate this by conducting performance benchmarks and substantiate
\vivit's usefulness by studying the impact of noise on the \ggn's structural
properties during neural network training.

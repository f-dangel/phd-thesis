\subsection{Hessian Trace
  (\robustInlinecode{HessTrace})}\label{cockpit::app:hessian-trace}

In comparison to \citet{yao2020pyhessian}, who leverage Hessian-vector products
\citep{pearlmutter1994fast} to estimate the Hessian trace, we compute the exact
value $\Tr(\mH_{\sB}(\vtheta))$ with the \inlinecode{HessTrace} quantity in
\cockpit by aggregating the output of \backpack's
\href{https://docs.backpack.pt/en/master/extensions.html#backpack.extensions.DiagHessian}{\inlinecode{DiagHessian}}
extension, which computes the diagonal entries of $\mH_{\sB}(\vtheta)$.
Alternatively, the trace can also be estimated with the \ggn matrix, or an
MC-sampled approximation thereof.

\subsubsection{Usage}

The Hessian trace equals the sum of the eigenvalues and thus provides a notion
of ``average curvature'' of the current loss landscape. It has long been
theorized and discussed that curvature and generalization performance may be
linked \cite[\eg]{hochreiter1997flat}.

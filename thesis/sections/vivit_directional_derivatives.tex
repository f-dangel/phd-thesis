A unique feature of \vivit{}'s quantities is that they provide a notion of
\textit{curvature uncertainty} through \textit{per-sample} first- and
second-order directional derivatives (\Cref{vivit::eq:gammas-lambdas}). To
quantify noise in these derivatives, we compute their signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs). For each direction $\ve_k$, the SNR is given by the squared empirical
mean divided by the empirical variance of the $N$ mini-batch samples
$\{\gamma_{n,k}\}_{n=1}^N$ and $\{\lambda_{n,k}\}_{n=1}^N$, respectively.

\Cref{vivit::fig:directional_derivatives} shows curvature SNRs during training
the \threecthreed network on \cifarten with \sgd. The curvature signal along the
top-$C$ eigenvectors decreases from $\text{SNR} > 1$ by two orders of magnitude.
In comparison, the directional gradients do not exhibit such a pattern (see
\Cref{vivit::sec:directional_derivatives}). Results for the other test cases can
be found in \Cref{vivit::sec:directional_derivatives}.

In this section, we have given a glimpse of the \textit{very rich} quantities
that can be efficiently computed under \vivit's concept. In
\Cref{vivit::sec:use_cases}, we discuss their practical use---curvature
uncertainty in particular.

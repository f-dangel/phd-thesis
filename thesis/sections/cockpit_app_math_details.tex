Here, we provide the mathematical background for each instrument in
\Cref{cockpit::tab:feature-table}. This complements the more informal
description presented in \Cref{cockpit::sec:instruments}, which focused more on
the expressiveness of the individual quantities. We start by setting up the
necessary notation in addition to the one introduced in
\Cref{cockpit::sec:instruments}. See
\Cref{sec:background::SupervisedLearning,sec:background::SecondOrderOptimization}
for more details.
